# MLC System with Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project implements a dynamic multi-label classification (MLC) system with anomaly detection and support for streaming data.

## Features
- Multi-label classification with support for different algorithms.
- Anomaly detection to identify new instances.
- Buffer for storing anomalous instances.
- Expert verification for new labels.
- Data preprocessing pipeline.
- Evaluation and monitoring of system performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
