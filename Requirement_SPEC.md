# SPEC-001: Dynamic Multi-Label Classification System with Anomaly Detection
## Background

The development of this system is driven by the need for a dynamic multi-label classification (MLC) solution capable of handling streaming data and evolving label sets. Traditional MLC systems often struggle with adapting to new data that may contain previously unseen labels, which is particularly challenging in high-stakes applications where accuracy and adaptability are crucial.

This system is designed to address these challenges by incorporating anomaly detection to identify potential new labels, a verification mechanism involving domain experts, and a flexible architecture that allows switching between different MLC methods or algorithms. By implementing these features, the system aims to maintain high classification accuracy while adapting to new and emerging data patterns.

## Requirements

The system must fulfill the following requirements, prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

### Must Have
- Implement multi-label classification (MLC) with the ability to switch between different algorithms.
- Support for streaming data input, specifically handling image data stored in a folder and loaded into memory.
- Anomaly detection to identify outliers or new instances with potential new labels.
- A buffer to store anomaly instances until a threshold is reached.
- A mechanism for experts to verify and confirm new labels detected by the anomaly detection algorithm.
- Update the MLC model with new labels upon expert confirmation.
- Evaluation phases for both standard MLC and MLC with unknown labels.
- Implementation in Python.

### Should Have
- Abstract class support for different data formats to allow future extensions.
- Configurable threshold for triggering expert verification based on anomaly detection confidence.

### Could Have
- A user-friendly interface for experts to interact with the system during the verification process.

### Won't Have
- Real-time streaming support for non-image data formats in the initial version.
- Automated expert verification without human intervention.

## Method

### Architecture Design

The architecture of the dynamic multi-label classification system is designed to handle streaming image data, detect anomalies, and update the model with new labels upon expert verification. The key components of the system include:

```plantuml
@startuml
package "MLC System" {
    component DataLoader {
        + load_data()
    }

    component MLCModel {
        + train_model()
        + predict_labels()
        + update_model()
        + switch_algorithm()
    }

    component AnomalyDetector {
        + detect_anomalies()
    }

    component Buffer {
        + add_instance()
        + is_threshold_reached()
    }

    component ExpertVerification {
        + verify_new_label()
    }

    component DataStreamer {
        + stream_data()
    }

    DataStreamer --> DataLoader
    DataLoader --> MLCModel : train_model()
    DataLoader --> MLCModel : predict_labels()
    MLCModel --> AnomalyDetector : predict_labels()
    AnomalyDetector --> Buffer : add_instance()

2. **Streaming Data Performance**:
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance on the incoming streaming data.
   - Track any degradation in performance over time and identify potential causes.

### Anomaly Detection Accuracy

1. **Evaluation of Anomaly Detector**:
   - Use a labeled dataset with known anomalies to test the accuracy of the anomaly detection algorithm.
   - Metrics to track: true positive rate (sensitivity), false positive rate, and anomaly detection precision.

2. **Buffer Management**:
   - Monitor the buffer for the frequency and types of instances being stored.
   - Ensure that the buffer is managing instances as expected and not exceeding memory constraints.

### New Label Detection and Verification

1. **Expert Verification Efficiency**:
   - Track the time taken for experts to verify and confirm new labels.
   - Ensure that the expert verification process is efficient and does not introduce significant delays.

2. **Accuracy of New Label Detection**:
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the new label detection algorithm by comparing detected labels against expert-confirmed labels.
   - Metrics to track: precision, recall, and F1 score for new label detection.

### System Scalability and Efficiency

1. **Data Streaming and Processing Performance**:
   - Measure the performance of the data streaming and processing components.
   - Metrics to track: data throughput (instances processed per second), processing latency, and system resource utilization (CPU, memory).

2. **Scalability Testing**:
   - Test the system's ability to handle increasing volumes of data.
   - Monitor for any bottlenecks or performance degradation as data volume scales.

3. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Track the resource utilization of the system to ensure efficient use of hardware and software resources.

   - Use feedback to refine and improve the anomaly detection, new label detection, and expert verification processes.

2. **Regular Updates**:
   - Schedule regular updates to the MLC model based on new data and feedback.
   - Ensure that the system remains adaptable and responsive to new and emerging data patterns.
